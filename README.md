This is an experiment in writing a [Morph](https://morph.io) scraper in [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript). At this stage it's a draft onlyâ€”but it does run and generate data using a fairly direct ClojureScript port of the base Node.js scraper. What I'd like to do with it is generate a repository of match report data from [arsenal.com](http://www.arsenal.com/home) or another thorough Arsenal Football Club news service.
